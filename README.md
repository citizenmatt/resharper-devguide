# ReSharper DevGuide

Welcome to the developer guide for the [ReSharper Platform](Intro/ReSharperPlatform.md). This is the primary source of documentation for developing extensions for the ReSharper Platform that ships as part of ReSharper 9.0.

To view the guide, please visit: https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/devguide

## Getting Started

* [**The ReSharper Platform**](Intro/ReSharperPlatform.md)
* [**About this Guide**](Intro/About.md)
* [**Key Topics**](Intro/KeyTopics.md)
* [**Getting Help**](Intro/GettingHelp.md)

## Open Source

This guide is Open Source, licensed under Apache 2.0. The source (as Markdown) is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-devguide), and built with GitBook. Please feel free to [raise issues](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-devguide/issues) or create pull requests to address incorrect or missing content.

The guide is very much a work in progress (the ReSharper Platform has a very large feature set and API surface), and is by no means a complete reference of the API. The table of contents provides a non-exhaustive list of available features, and shows missing content by greying out the page. Issues are a great way of prioritising what documentation needs to be addressed first. Please let us know what we should focus on!

## Previous versions

This guide is aimed at the latest version of the ReSharper Platform, which is currently shipping with ReSharper 9.0. [Previous versions of the developer guide](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/NETCOM/ReSharper+Plugin+Development) are also available, if you wish to build extensions for ReSharper 8.x and earlier.

This guide is aimed at ReSharper 9.0, but many of the features and ideas also apply to ReSharper 8.x and earlier.
